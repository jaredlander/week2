## Conclusions \label{sec:Conclusions}
Rapidly changing situation, total number of affected areas unknown.  Need operative information quickly.  Survey process in total was 20 days; prior large scale surveys have been 35-40 days from conception to reporting of results.  It was this short because experienced teams were already in the field.  With a smaller sample, fieldwork could have been cut from 5 to 2 or 3 days. With salary costs about \_\_% of the total, the cost of carrying out the survey would have been about \_\_% less, with no notable loss in information generated.

So go to more places, identify various key subgroups of the population better, and take a smaller overall sample to optimize the efficiency and reduce the time and cost of such a survey.
