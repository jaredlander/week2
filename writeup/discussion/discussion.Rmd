## Discussion \label{sec:Discussion}
Cannot say the total sample was true measure of the population but it was adequate to characterize population conditions and needs.

Could a similar result have been reached with a smaller sample?

Defining logistical question was distance to reach the tehsil. Once reached, how many villages to sample in a day was set at 3.
